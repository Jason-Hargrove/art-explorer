Project Idea: "Art Explorer"
An interactive platform where users can explore museums, art galleries, and specific artworks worldwide using Google Maps and a product carousel to display featured art pieces or gallery exhibits.

## Key Features:
1. Museum/Gallery Map Integration: Use Google Maps to pinpoint museums or art galleries. When users click on a location, they’ll see a carousel of featured exhibits or artworks from that museum.

2. Artwork Carousel: Use react-slick or swiper to display a rotating gallery of artworks, where each piece can have detailed descriptions, an image, and interactive elements (like zooming in or rotating the artwork using react-image-turntable).

3. Museum Information & Exhibitions: Include rich-text content about each museum or gallery, rendered using @graphcms/rich-text-react-renderer, allowing for dynamic descriptions, history, and current exhibitions.

4. Interactive Forms: Create forms where users can filter museums or artworks by location, artist, or style using react-hook-form. For example, users can search for "Impressionist art in Paris" and get relevant museum/gallery results.

5. State Management: Manage user preferences (like their favorite museums or saved art pieces) using Zustand. You can also use it to track selected regions or filters in the map view.

6. Animations with GSAP: Animate the appearance of artwork cards, map transitions when switching between locations, or even interactive transitions as users explore different regions of the world.

7. Dark Mode with TailwindCSS: Implement a dark mode for a sleek, modern feel. Dark modes are great for exploring artwork, especially photography or digitally created art, as it reduces eye strain.

## Bonus Features:
1. Virtual Tours: Integrate YouTube videos or embed links for virtual tours of museums or galleries, using get-youtube-id to easily display relevant videos for each gallery.

2. Explore by Region or Art Movement: Let users explore museums by art movement (like Renaissance or Abstract) using filters and categories, all managed through Zustand.

3. Custom Google Maps Styling: Customize your Google Map to have a unique artistic or vintage style, adding an extra layer of creativity to the project.

4. By focusing on art, you’ll be able to combine your interests in both development and the art world, creating a unique portfolio project that showcases not just your technical skills but also your artistic side. How does that sound for your personal portfolio?

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
